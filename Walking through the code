As is often the case, hours of work ended up being less than 20 lines of code. 

I was working with data that I used for a regular expressions challenge and I extracted the latitude and longitude coordinates
with a regular expression. Separately, I found a tutorial online for gmap - the google maps API. Figuring out how to request a 
google maps API was frustrating until I found the right webpage that walked me through it step by step. This tutorial, which
also took me a long time to find, also showed how to use the gmplot - a module for google maps - to plot coordinates onto a 
google map. The test worked, then I hardcoded 8 coordinates into the list and it worked, but I hit a wall when I needed to put 
my 3000+ coordinates into the gmap and gmplot code as a list. 

Eventually, I realized that the data I was working with was a TSV instead of a CSV. I opened it with Numbers and converted it 
to a CSV. I then used Pandas - another module - to manipulate the CSV data into a list. With the help of google and other
tutorials, I figured out the code to extract the latitude column and the longitude column as lists and put them into my gmplot
code. From that point it was just a matter of playing around with the appearance of the lines and points.
